# Labs
## Introduction
Welcome to the Labs repository! This repository contains lab setups that I used for my Red Hat certification exam preparation. The repository provides a collection of lab environments designed to help you prepare for Red Hat certifications. These setups will deploy the infrastructure on demand and will be destroyed after use.

## Lab Setups

Here are some of the lab setups included in this repository:
- **Lab 1:** RHCSA
- **Lab 2:** RHCE
- **Lab 3:** Kubernets

## Usage

To use these lab setups, follow the instructions provided in each lab's directory. Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new lab setups to add, please submit a pull request.
